h1. git2svn

This is a script to migrate a Git repository to SVN preserving the commits history. This is not something that people will use a lot, but in case you need to do something like this (like I did - don't ask me why), you might want to use this script.

If you don't need to preserve your history, there's a "good guide on Google Code explaining how to migrate in a simpler way":http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/ImportingFromGit.

h2. Usage

1) Clone your Git repository and checkout your SVN repository:

<pre>$ git clone git://github.com/guilhermechapiewski/myrepo.git git_repo
$ svn checkout https://myrepo.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ svn_repo</pre>

2) Configure *git2svn.sh* variables (*GIT_DIR* and *SVN_DIR*) with locations of both repositories.

3) Run the script from anywhere except one of these two directories.

h2. Example

If you want to see an example migration, check the following repositories:

Source: "http://github.com/acarlos1000/MemeiPad/commits/master":http://github.com/acarlos1000/MemeiPad/commits/master
Destination: "http://code.google.com/p/memeipad/source/list":http://code.google.com/p/memeipad/source/list

h2. Be careful

This script will delete everything from your SVN repository when the first commit is migrated.
